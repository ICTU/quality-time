## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.3] - [2019-07-01]

### Fixed

- Time travelling to a date before any report existed would throw an exception on the server. Fixes [#416](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/416).
- Trend graphs would be too tall and overlap with the next metric. Fixes [#420](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/420).
- When clicking the report date field in the menubar, the calendar popup would be displayed at the wrong location before popping up at the right location. Fixes [#424](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/424).

## [0.2.2] - [2019-06-28]

### Fixed

- Version number was missing in the footer of the frontend. Fixes [#410](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/420).

## [0.2.1] - [2019-06-26]

### Fixed

- Work around a limitation of the Travis configuration file. The deploy script doesn't allow sequences, which is surprising since scripts in other parts of the Travis configuration file do allow sequences. See https://github.com/travis-ci/dpl/issues/673.

## [0.2.0] - [2019-06-26]

### Added

- Release Docker containers from [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/ICTU/quality-time) to [Docker Hub](https://cloud.docker.com/u/ictu/repository/list?name=quality-time&namespace=ictu).

## [0.1.0] - [2019-06-24]

### Added

- Initial release consisting of a metric collector, a webserver, a frontend, and a database component.
