    shortDescription: Quality-time is an automated quality system for software
      development and maintenance.
    longDescription: >
      *Quality-time* is a quality monitoring application for software
      development and maintenance *Quality-time* collects measurement data
      from sources such as GitLab, SonarQube, Jira, Azure DevOps, and OWASP
      Dependency-Check, to provide an overview of the quality of software
      products, processes, and projects. It does so by comparing measurement
      data with metric targets and informing development teams about the
      metrics that need improvement actions.

      Technically, *Quality-time* consists of a React frontend, a Mongo database
      server, and a number of backend components written in Python: a worker
      component to collect measurement data from the sources, a worker component
      to send notifications, an API-server for the frontend, and an API-server
      for the worker components.

      Users can add and configure reports, metrics, and sources (such as
      SonarQube and Jira) in the frontend. The collector retrieves data from the
      configured metric sources, determines the measurements, and stores them in
      the database. The frontend calls the server to get the reports and the
      measurements and presents them to the user.

      *Quality-time* is developed by [ICTU](https://www.ictu.nl/en/about-us), an
      impartial project organization within the government. ICTU's services
      consist of the realization of projects and programs, giving advice, and
      development of custom made software solutions. Driven by quality, with a
      heart for the public task, not for profit.

    features:
      - Robust data collection (the collector should never fail, even in the
        face of misconfigured or unavailable sources).
      - Measurement history is kept in a database, allowing for time travel.
      - Report configuration via the UI.
      - Multiple reports in one Quality-time instance.
      - LDAP-integration.
      - Generic false-positive management.
      - Metric tags can be used to summarize metrics with the same tag across
        subjects, e.g. to summarize all security metrics.
      - Export of reports to PDF, both via the UI as well as via the API.
      - Notifications of events, such as metrics turning red, to Microsoft
        Teams.
      - Side-by-side comparison of measurements at different points in time.
      - Integration with issue tracker (Jira only at the moment) to manage
        actions and technical debt.
      - Dark and light UI mode.
