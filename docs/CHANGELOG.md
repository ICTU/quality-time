## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Users can now select a suggestion and edit it in input fields with suggestions. Closes [#197](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/197).
- Users can now login with both their canonical LDAP name as well as with their LDAP user id. Closes [#492](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/492).
- Allow for using (a safe subset of) HTML and URL's in metric comment fields. Closes [#511](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/511).
- Added OWASP Dependency Check Jenkins plugin as possible source for the security warnings metric. Closes [#535](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/535).

### Fixed

- Break long urls in source error messages to keep the metrics table from becoming very wide. Fixes [#531](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/531).
- Don't try to retrieve more work items from Azure DevOps than allowed. Fixes [#532](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/532).
- Return a parse error if OWASP dependency report XML reports don't contain the expected root tag instead of reporting zero issues. Fixes [#536](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/536).

## [0.6.0] - [2019-08-11]

### Added

- Keep track of changes made by users in a change log. The change log for a report can be viewed by expanding the report title. The change log for a subject can be viewed by expanding the subject title. The change logs for metric and their sources be viewed by expanding the metric. Closes [#285](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/285).
- When the user session is expired (after 24 hours) log out the user and notify them of the expired session. Closes [#373](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/373).
- Added a metric for measuring the duration of manual tests. Added Jira as default source for the metric. Closes [#481](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/481).

### Fixed

- When using OWASP ZAP reports as source for the security warnings metric, report on the number of "instances" instead of "alert items". Fixes [#467](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/467).
- Don't wait 15 minutes before trying to access a requested Checkmarx SAST XML report, but try again after one minute. Partial fix for [#468](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/468).
- The performancetest-runner now uses "scalability" instead of "ramp-up" as name for the scalability measurement. Closes [#480](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/480).
- OJAudit XML files may contain duplicate violations (i.e. same message, same severity, same model, same location, same everything) which led to problems in the user interface. Fixed by merging multiple duplication violations and adding a count field to the violations. Fixes [#515](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/515).
- Use Jenkins job timestamp for the source up-to-dateness metric if the Jenkins test report doesn't contain timestamps in the test report itself. Fixes [#517](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/517).
- Stop sorting metrics when the user adds a new metric to prevent it from jumping around due to the sorting. Fixes [#518](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/518).

## [0.5.1] - [2019-07-18]

### Fixed

- The Trello parameter "lists to ignore" was not displayed properly. Fixes [#471](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/471).
- The number of issues would not be measured if the source was Jira. Fixes [#475](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/475).

## [0.5.0] - [2019-07-16]

### Added

- Added Pyup.io Safety JSON reports as possible source for the security warnings metric. Closes [#450](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/450).
- Added Bandit JSON reports as possible source for the security warnings metric and the source up-to-dateness metric. Closes [#454](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/454).
- Only measure metrics that have all mandatory parameters supplied. Closes [#462](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/462).

### Fixed

- Add performance test stability and scalability metrics to the example report. Fixes [#447](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/447).
- Set up a new LDAP connection for each authentication in an attempt to prevent a "Broken pipe" between Quality-time and the LDAP-server. Fixes [#469](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/469).

## [0.4.1] - [2019-07-08]

### Fixed

- Frontend can't reach server.

## [0.4.0] - [2019-07-07]

### Changed

- Run server on port 5001 instead of 8080 to reduce chances of interfering with other applications.
- Allow for deployments where the different components all have the same hostname, e.g. quality-time.example.org, and only the ports differ.

## [0.3.0] - [2019-07-05]

### Added

- Metric for performancetest duration added. Closes [#401](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/401).
- Metric for performancetest stability added. Closes [#433](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/433).
- Metric for performance scalability added. Closes [#434](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/434).
- [Performancetest-runner](https://github.com/ICTU/performancetest-runner) reports can now be used as metric source for the tests and failed tests metrics. Closes [#402](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/402).

## [0.2.3] - [2019-07-01]

### Fixed

- Time travelling to a date before any report existed would throw an exception on the server. Fixes [#416](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/416).
- Trend graphs would be too tall and overlap with the next metric. Fixes [#420](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/420).
- When clicking the report date field in the menu bar, the calendar popup would be displayed at the wrong location before popping up at the right location. Fixes [#424](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/424).

## [0.2.2] - [2019-06-28]

### Fixed

- Version number was missing in the footer of the frontend. Fixes [#410](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/420).

## [0.2.1] - [2019-06-26]

### Fixed

- Work around a limitation of the Travis configuration file. The deploy script does not allow sequences, which is surprising since scripts in other parts of the Travis configuration file do allow sequences. See [https://github.com/travis-ci/dpl/issues/673](https://github.com/travis-ci/dpl/issues/673).

## [0.2.0] - [2019-06-26]

## [0.1.0] - [2019-06-24]

### Added

- Initial release consisting of a metric collector, a web server, a frontend, and a database component.
