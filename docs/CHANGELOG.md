- Immediate check of url's accessibility added.  Closes [#478](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/478).
- When measuring unmerged branches, have the metric landing url point to the list of branches in GitLab or Azure DevOps. When measuring the source up-to-dateness of a folder or file in GitLab or Azure DevOps, have the metric landing url point to the folder or file. Closes [#711](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/711).
- When SonarQube is the source for a metric, users can now select the branch to use. Note that only the commercial editions of SonarQube support branch analysis. Closes [#712](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/712).
- Subjects can be reordered. Expand a subject title to show the reordering buttons on the lower left-hand side of the subject title panel. The buttons allow one to move a subject to the top of the page, to the previous position, to the next position, and to the bottom of the page. Closes [#716](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/716).
- Allow for filtering accessibility violations from Axe CSV files by impact level. Closes [#730](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/730).

## [0.13.0] - [2019-10-20]

### Added

- Quality-time now counts the unmerged branches against the default branch in GitLab or Azure DevOps instead of assuming that the master branch is the default branch. Closes [#699](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/699).

### Changed

- The "Size (LOC)" metric can now either count all lines of code or all non-commented lines of code. That means the "Size (Non-commented LOC)" metric is now deprecated. Closes [#644](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/644).

### Fixed

- Allow for specifying an Azure DevOps repository by name. Fixes [#683](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/683).

## [0.12.2] - [2019-10-16]

### Fixed

- Remove white space at the top of the page in printouts. Fixes [#685](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/685).

### Changed

- Quality-time now uses Python 3.8 for the collector and server components. Closes [#684](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/684).

## [0.12.1] - [2019-10-14]

### Fixed

- Do not repeat the top menu bar in printouts, it overlaps with content. Fixes [#680](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/680).

## [0.12.0] - [2019-10-11]

### Fixed

- Because Checkmarx does not immediately return detail information, Checkmarx measurements would alternate between measurements with and without detail information, resulting in a lot of measurements in the database. Fixed by not collecting detail information from Checkmarx anymore. Fixes [#670](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/670).
- Sources that don't need to access the network ("Calendar", "Manual number", "Random number") would throw an exception. Fixes [#672](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/672).
- NCover reports weren't parsed correctly. Fixes [#675](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/675).

### Removed

- Quality-time no longer collects detail information about security warnings from Checkmarx; the Checkmarx API is too complex, resulting in fragile interaction between Quality-time and Checkmarx. See [#670](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/672).

## [0.11.0] - [2019-10-07]

### Fixed

- Allow for specifying which test results (skipped, failed, errored, and/or passed) to count when using SonarQube as source for the "Tests" metric. Fixes [#634](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/634).
- Store measurement values for each scale that a metric supports so that the graphs show correct information when the user changes the metric scale. Fixes [#637](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/637).
- Do not stop contacting sources after receiving a 401 (Unauthorized) or 403 (Forbidden). Fixes [#652](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/652).

### Added

- Add NCover coverage reports as source for the test coverage metrics. Closes [#635](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/635).
- Add Azure DevOps as source for the "Tests" metric. Requires Azure Devops Server or Service 2019. Closes [#639](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/639).
- Add Azure DevOps as source for the "Source up-to-dateness" metric. Closes [#640](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/640).
- Add Azure DevOps as source for the "Unmerged branches" metric. Closes [#641](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/641).
- Add percentage scale to the "Complex units", "Many parameters", "Long units", and "Suppressed violations" metrics. Closes [#645](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/645).

## [0.10.2] - [2019-09-26]

## [0.10.1] - [2019-09-25]

### Fixed

- Measuring size (LOC), size (non-commented LOC), tests, and failed tests using SonarQube as source would fail with a parse error. Fixes [#623](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/623).

## [0.10.0] - [2019-09-22]

### Added

- All metrics now have an explicit scale that's either fixed to "Count" or "Percentage", or that can be changed from "Count to "Percentage" and vice versa. Metrics whose scale can be changed: "Duplicated lines", "Metrics", "Test branch coverage", and "Test line coverage". Closes [#504](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/504).
- Added a 'landing url' parameter to some sources so Quality-time can refer users to a human readable version of a machine readable report. For example, you can add an HTML version of a JaCoCo report to a JaCoCo XML report source. Closes [#554](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/554).

## [0.9.1] - [2019-09-10]

### Fixed

- To prevent reporting Checkmarx internal server errors to users when reports are unexpectedly unavailable, don't immediately remove a Checkmarx report after reading it, but silently ignore a removed report and create a new one. Fixes [#468](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/468).
- Prevent locked accounts by not contacting a source again after receiving a 401 (unauthorized) or 403 (forbidden) HTTP status, until the metric's configuration changes. Fixes [#604](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/604).

## [0.9.0] - [2019-09-06]

### Added

- The direction of metrics is now configurable. The direction of a metric determines whether smaller measurements are better, or bigger measurements are better. This means that the "number of tests" metric, with its direction reversed, can now also be used to measure the number of failing tests. The "failing tests" metric is deprecated. Closes [#552](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/552).
- Metrics can be reordered. Expand a metric to show the reordering buttons on the lower left-hand side of the metric details. The buttons allow one to move a metric to the top of the table, to the previous row, to the next row, and to the bottom of the table. Closes [#585](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/585).

### Fixed

- Checkmarx internal server error solved. Fixes [#468](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/468).
- Use a consistent style for labels of input fields. Fixes [#579](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/579).
- Added Quality-time logo to the Quality-time source. Fixes [#580](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/580).
- When adding HQ as source for the accessibility metric, show the URL and metric id parameters. Fixes [#587](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/587).
- The layout of the reports overview dashboard would be reset after visiting a tag report. Fixes [#588](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/588).
- Tag report donut charts were always white. Fixes [#589](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/589).

## [0.8.2] - [2019-08-28]

### Fixed

- Prevent web browsers from automatically filling in username and password in the source configuration tab. Fixes [#574](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/574).

## [0.8.1] - [2019-08-28]

### Fixed

- Changing the subject type now changes the subject name if the default subject name has not been overridden. Fixes [#553](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/553).
- When a user changes a password field, don't show the old password in the change log unmasked. Fixes [#565](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/565).
- Use <= and >= for the metric direction in the metric tables instead of < and >. Fixes [#567](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/567).

## [0.8.0] - [2019-08-23]

### Added

- Add meta metrics and the ability to add *Quality-time* itself as source for the meta metrics. Closes [#337](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/337).
- Accessibility metric for Axe report source added. Closes [#338](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/338).

### Fixed

- Don't use the unicode characters for <= and >= in the source code; it caused problems on Windows. Fixes [#558](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/558).

## [0.7.1] - [2019-08-18]

### Fixed

- When generating keys for OWASP ZAP security warnings, strip any hashes from the application urls to ensure the keys are stable. Fixes [#541](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/541).
- In addition to version 2.0 also support version 2.1 and 2.2 of the OWASP Dependency Check XML format. Fixes [#543](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/543).

## [0.7.0] - [2019-08-14]

### Added

- Users can now select a suggestion and edit it in input fields with suggestions. Closes [#197](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/197).
- Users can now login with both their canonical LDAP name as well as with their LDAP user id. Closes [#492](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/492).
- Allow for using (a safe subset of) HTML and URL's in metric comment fields. Closes [#511](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/511).
- Added OWASP Dependency Check Jenkins plugin as possible source for the security warnings metric. Closes [#535](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/535).

### Fixed

- Break long lines in OpenVAS security warning description to keep the metrics table from becoming very wide. Fixes [#452](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/452).
- Break long urls in source error messages to keep the metrics table from becoming very wide. Fixes [#531](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/531).
- Don't try to retrieve more work items from Azure DevOps than allowed. Fixes [#532](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/532).
- Return a parse error if OWASP dependency report XML reports don't contain the expected root tag instead of reporting zero issues. Fixes [#536](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/536).

## [0.6.0] - [2019-08-11]

### Added

- Keep track of changes made by users in a change log. The change log for a report can be viewed by expanding the report title. The change log for a subject can be viewed by expanding the subject title. The change logs for metric and their sources be viewed by expanding the metric. Closes [#285](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/285).
- When the user session is expired (after 24 hours) log out the user and notify them of the expired session. Closes [#373](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/373).
- Added a metric for measuring the duration of manual tests. Added Jira as default source for the metric. Closes [#481](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/481).

### Fixed

- When using OWASP ZAP reports as source for the security warnings metric, report on the number of "instances" instead of "alert items". Fixes [#467](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/467).
- Don't wait 15 minutes before trying to access a requested Checkmarx SAST XML report, but try again after one minute. Partial fix for [#468](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/468).
- The performancetest-runner now uses "scalability" instead of "ramp-up" as name for the scalability measurement. Closes [#480](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/480).
- OJAudit XML files may contain duplicate violations (i.e. same message, same severity, same model, same location, same everything) which led to problems in the user interface. Fixed by merging multiple duplication violations and adding a count field to the violations. Fixes [#515](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/515).
- Use Jenkins job timestamp for the source up-to-dateness metric if the Jenkins test report doesn't contain timestamps in the test report itself. Fixes [#517](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/517).
- Stop sorting metrics when the user adds a new metric to prevent it from jumping around due to the sorting. Fixes [#518](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/518).

## [0.5.1] - [2019-07-18]

### Fixed

- The Trello parameter "lists to ignore" was not displayed properly. Fixes [#471](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/471).
- The number of issues would not be measured if the source was Jira. Fixes [#475](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/475).

## [0.5.0] - [2019-07-16]

### Added

- Added Pyup.io Safety JSON reports as possible source for the security warnings metric. Closes [#450](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/450).
- Added Bandit JSON reports as possible source for the security warnings metric and the source up-to-dateness metric. Closes [#454](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/454).
- Only measure metrics that have all mandatory parameters supplied. Closes [#462](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/462).

### Fixed

- Add performance test stability and scalability metrics to the example report. Fixes [#447](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/447).
- Set up a new LDAP connection for each authentication in an attempt to prevent a "Broken pipe" between Quality-time and the LDAP-server. Fixes [#469](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/469).

## [0.4.1] - [2019-07-08]

### Fixed

- Frontend can't reach server.

## [0.4.0] - [2019-07-07]

### Changed

- Run server on port 5001 instead of 8080 to reduce chances of interfering with other applications.
- Allow for deployments where the different components all have the same hostname, e.g. quality-time.example.org, and only the ports differ.

## [0.3.0] - [2019-07-05]

### Added

- Metric for performancetest duration added. Closes [#401](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/401).
- Metric for performancetest stability added. Closes [#433](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/433).
- Metric for performance scalability added. Closes [#434](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/434).
- [Performancetest-runner](https://github.com/ICTU/performancetest-runner) reports can now be used as metric source for the tests and failed tests metrics. Closes [#402](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/402).

## [0.2.3] - [2019-07-01]

### Fixed

- Time travelling to a date before any report existed would throw an exception on the server. Fixes [#416](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/416).
- Trend graphs would be too tall and overlap with the next metric. Fixes [#420](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/420).
- When clicking the report date field in the menu bar, the calendar popup would be displayed at the wrong location before popping up at the right location. Fixes [#424](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/424).

## [0.2.2] - [2019-06-28]

### Fixed

- Version number was missing in the footer of the frontend. Fixes [#410](https://github.com/ICTU/quality-time/issues/420).

## [0.2.1] - [2019-06-26]

### Fixed
