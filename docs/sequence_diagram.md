## Explanation of diagram

When the user opens the dashboard of Quality-Time, the **frontend** gets loaded. After the **frontend** is loaded, the user can open a report. The **frontend** will create a GET request to the **server** requesting the report. The **server** will also make GET request to the **database**. The **database** will in return do a POST request to the **server** with the report data. After this the **server** will do a POST request to the **frontend** with the report data. This shows that the Server is the central point of communication, every component only talks to the **server** and **not with eachother**.  

After you open the report, there will be metrics in this report. For every metric the **frontend** will make a GET request to the **server** asking for the measurements for the metric. The **server** then will make a GET request to read the measurements to the **database**. The **database** will make a POST request back to the **server** containing the measurements. The **server** then will make POST request back to the **frontend** containing themeasurements.  

In the background there is a mechanism that will ensure that the reports are up to date with the latest information available from the **sources**. This mechanism is called the **collector**. The **collector** runs in a loop periodically. When this loop starts the **collector** makes a GET request to the **server** asking for all the metrics. The **server** then makes a GET request to the **database** asking for all the metrics. After this request the **database** returns all the metrics using a POST request to the **server**. The **server** then passes this data containing all the metrics to the **collector**. After this part is finished of the loop the next part starts, which also is a loop. This loop runs on every metric that got returned earlier in the loop. Inside this second loop there is a third loop, this third loop runs for each of the metric its sources. In this third loop the **collector** does a GET request for source data to the **sources** of the metrics. Then the **sources** return source data to the **collector** using a POST request. Now the third loop is finished it can continue the second loop. In the second loop the **collector** will make a POST request to the **server** containing all the measurements for the metric. And the **server** will make a POST request to the **database** for storing the measurements.
