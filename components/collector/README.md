# Quality-time collector

## Overview

The collector is responsible for collecting measurement data from sources. It wakes up once every minute and asks the server for a list of all metrics. For each metric, the collector gets the measurement data from each of the metric's sources and posts a new measurement to the server.

If a metric has been recently measured and its parameters haven't been changed, the collector skips the metric.

## Health check

Every time the collector wakes up, it writes the current date and time in ISO format to the 'health_check.txt' file. This date and time is read by the Docker health check (see the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile)). If the written date and time are too long ago, the collector container is considered to be unhealthy.

## Configuration

The collector uses the following environment variables:

| Name | Default value | Description |
| :--- | :---------- | :------------ |
| SERVER_HOST | server | Hostname of the server. The collector uses this to get the metrics and post the measurements. |
| SERVER_PORT | 5001 | Port of the server. The collector uses this to get the metrics and post the measurements. |
| COLLECTOR_SLEEP_DURATION | 60 | The amount of time (in seconds) that the collector sleeps after collecting measurements. |
| COLLECTOR_MEASUREMENT_FREQUENCY | 900 | The amount of time (in seconds) after which a metric should be measured again. |
